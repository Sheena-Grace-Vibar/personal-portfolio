            <h1>Embarking on the Full Stack Journey: My Experience with CLI, GIT, HTML and CSS</h1>
            <p>Before delving into the intricacies of HTML and CSS, my journey in full stack development commenced with familiarizing myself with the Command Line Interface (CLI) and Git. These foundational tools laid the groundwork for effective project management and version control, pivotal aspects in the development process. As I embarked on my journey into full stack development, I quickly understood the significance of mastering CLI, Git, and the basics of HTML and CSS. These essential tools and technologies form the foundation of web development, providing the structure and style necessary to create high-quality and vibrant websites, all while ensuring code organization and version control through Git. Understanding CSS is particularly crucial, as it enables me to leverage frameworks and libraries effectively in the future.</p>
            <p>In this article, I'll share my experiences and insights as I delved deeper into HTML and CSS, discussing the fundamentals I've grasped, the challenges I've faced, and the invaluable resources that have guided me along the way.</p>
            <h3>Exploring CLI and Git: Building Blocks of Efficient Development</h3>
            <p>The Command Line Interface (CLI) serves as a powerful tool for interacting with computers through text commands, enabling streamlined navigation, file manipulation, and software installation. Git, on the other hand, revolutionizes collaboration and version control by allowing developers to track changes, merge code seamlessly, and maintain project integrity.</p>
            <p>Despite the benefits they offer, mastering CLI and Git presented its own set of challenges. I often found myself struggling to remember which Git command to use in specific scenarios, leading to moments of frustration and confusion. There were instances where I inadvertently used the wrong Git command, resulting in unexpected outcomes and errors in my repository. Additionally, I encountered challenges such as pushing changes to the wrong branch, which disrupted the flow of my studies.</p>
            <p>With consistent practice and the guidance of assigned homework, I've gradually familiarized myself with Git commands. Each day of practice has contributed to my growing confidence in navigating Git effectively.</p>
            <h3>Understanding HTML: The Backbone of the Web</h3>
            <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, forms the backbone of every web page. If we compare it to a human body, HTML is like the skeleton. It provides the structure and content of a website, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, forms, and links, much like how bones define and support various parts of the body. As a beginner, grasping the basic syntax and structure of HTML was my first step in building my understanding of web development.</p>
            <p>One of the early challenges I encountered was learning how to effectively structure tables and forms in HTML and how these elements interact with each other. However, through practice and experimentation, I became more confident in organizing my HTML documents efficiently. The exercises assigned by Ms. Jem were particularly helpful, as they aligned perfectly with the difficulties I was facing, providing me with valuable practice.</p>
            <h3>Mastering CSS: Bringing Style to the Web</h3>
            <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to add visual style and layout to HTML elements. Learning CSS allowed me to enhance the appearance of my web pages, from adjusting colors and fonts to creating responsive layouts.</p>
            <p>One of the coolest things about learning CSS was figuring out how to pick and style different parts of my webpage, and how styles flow down from one to another. Trying out different CSS tricks and seeing how they changed the look of my webpage was really fun and a bit challenging. I still remember the first time I colored a paragraphâ€”I was so happy because I finally understood how people make text look colorful on webpages.</p>
            <h3>Overcoming Challenges and Finding Resources</h3>
            <p>Like any new endeavor, learning HTML and CSS came with its fair share of challenges. From understanding the syntaxes, choosing appropriate semantic elements, to ensuring that your code works smoothly on any browser without any compatibility problems could be pretty overwhelming. But I learned that if I kept trying and asked for help when I needed it, I could tackle those challenges and keep moving forward.</p>
            <p>The valuable resources that helped me immensely was online tutorials especially Youtube tutorials and documentation. Websites like MDN Web Docs and W3Schools provided clear explanations and examples of HTML and CSS concepts, allowing me to learn at my own pace.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Starting my journey into full stack development with CLI, Git, HTML and CSS has been a mix of tough challenges and great rewards. From getting the hang of the basics such as familiarizing git commands, choosing semantic HTML elements and syntax, to tackling tough concepts like figuring Flexbox and Grid, my journey with these building block technologies have set me up for success in the future. As I keep learning, I can't wait to dive into more advanced technologies, knowing that a strong grasp of HTML and CSS will always be the foundation of my developer skills.</p>
